# iGenics Sales Data Pipeline with SQL Database Integration
In this project, I built a complete end-to-end ETL and analytics pipeline by transforming raw weekly sales data into a structured MySQL database. I automated ETL pipelines based on Python to clean, standardize, and integrate 83 total weeks of sales data for iGenics, a GMP certified and US-manufactured health supplement.

# Outcomes 
Evaluated weekly revenue and profitability trends for the product across two years, identifying seasonal patterns and performance shifts

Leveraged filtered data to produce accurate in-role insights, quantifying $854,969 in revenue (2024) and $775,592 in revenue (Jan 2025-Jul 2025)

Developed clear, year-segmented dashboards using matplotlib, highlighting net income of $188,184 in 2024 and $169,276 in 2025 (Jan-Jul) and enabling direct comparison of profitability trends to guide data-driven decision-making

Did not include the original datasets due to concerns related to leaking proprietary data but included the cleaned and scaled dataset for demonstration purposes
