# iGenics-Retail-Sales-Database
In this project, I built a complete end-to-end ETL and analytics pipeline by transforming raw weekly sales data into a structured MySQL database. I automated ETL pipelines based on Python to clean, standardize, and integrate 83 total weeks of sales data for iGenics, a GMP certified and US-manufactured health supplement.
